		<h2> About Us </h2>
		<p> This application was created by 3 University of California, San Diego
				Computer Science students. We found that many students procrastinate on
				their work because they feel that they can complete it later. However,
				as time passes they forget to do their work and end up doing a rushed
				effort or nothing. We let users jot down their tasks, and we assign
				a time for them to complete it</p>
		<h2> How to use the application </h2>
		<p> Users can get started with the application by clicking on the plus symbol
				on the top right corner to add a task. If one is adding a task with a
				predetermined time and/or location, they can do so through the Advanced
				Settings. After the users adds a few tasks that are routine to their day,
				they can go on to add one time tasks, that are then fit into the schedule
				between their existing tasks.</p>
